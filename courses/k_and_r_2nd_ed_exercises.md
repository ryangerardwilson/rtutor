# K&R 2nd Ed Exercises

## Part IA: Chapter 1

### Lesson 1: Hello World

    // Ex: Run the ``hello, world'' program on your system. 

### Lesson 2: \c

    // Experiment to find out what happens when prints's argument 
    // string contains \c

### Lesson 3: Temperature Conversion

    // Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading 
    // above the table.

### Lesson 4: Celsius to Fahrenheit

    // Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to 
    // Fahrenheit table.

### Lesson 5: Temperature Conversion Reversed

    // Modify the temperature conversion program to print the 
    // table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0.

### Lesson 6: getchar()

    // Verify that the expression getchar() != EOF is 0 or 1.

### Lesson 7: EOF

    // Write a program to print the value of EOF.

### Lesson 8: Counting chars

    // Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.

### Lesson 9: Copy Input to Output I

    // Write a program to copy its input to its output, 
    // replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank.

### Lesson 10: Copy Input to Output II

    // Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing 
    // each tab by \t, each backspace by \b, and each backslash by \\. 
    // This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way.

### Lesson 11: Testing the Word Count Program

    // How would you test the word count program? What kinds of 
    // input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

### Lesson 12: Print Input

    // Write a program that prints its input one word per line.

## Part IB: Chapter 1

### Lesson 13: Histogram of Lengths of Input Words

    // Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words 
    // in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars 
    // horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.

### Lesson 14: Histogram of Freq of Different Characters

    // Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of 
    // different characters in its input.

### Lesson 15: Functions

    // Rewrite the temperature conversion program of Section 1.2 to 
    // use a function for conversion.

### Lesson 16: Longest Line

    // Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it 
    // will correctly print the length of arbitrary long input 
    // lines, and as much as possible of the text.

### Lesson 17: Input Lines > 80 Chars

    // Write a program to print all input lines that are longer 
    // than 80 characters.

### Lesson 18: Cleaning Input

    // Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from 
    // each line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines.

### Lesson 19: Reverse String

    // Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character 
    // string s. Use it to write a program that reverses its 
    // input a line at a time.

## Part IC: Chapter 1

### Lesson 20: detab

    // Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input 
    // with the proper number of blanks to space to the next 
    // tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n 
    // columns.  Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter? 

### Lesson 21: entab

    // Write a program entab that replaces strings of blanks by 
    // the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same 
    // spacing. Use the same tab stops as for detab. When either 
    // a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, 
    // which should be given preference?

### Lesson 22: Fold Long Input Lines

    // Write a program to ``fold'' long input lines into two or 
    // more shorter lines after the last non-blank character that 
    // occurs before the n-th column of input. Make sure your 
    // program does something intelligent with very long lines, 
    // and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column.

### Lesson 23: Remove Comments

    // Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. 
    // Don't forget to handle quoted strings and character constants 
    // properly. C comments don't nest.

### Lesson 24: Syntax Errors

    // Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax 
    // errors like unmatched parentheses, brackets and braces. Don't 
    // forget about quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, 
    // and comments. This program is hard if you do it in full 
    // generality.
